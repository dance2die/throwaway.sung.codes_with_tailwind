# Sung.codes Nav with Tailwind CSS

## What?

Re-implementation of sung.codes header with Tailwind CSS

## Thoughts

I am still not yet versed in TW thus had hard time keeping classes organized and they are all over.

Easier to get started but using it on one HTML file seems to be an overkill.

TW seems to shine with a component model, where you deal with a small bits of HTML code.
